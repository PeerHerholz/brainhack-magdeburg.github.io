# Social event - relaxed meet&greet/hangout via zoom

We'll have a social event on the first day of our Brainhack (07/12/2021), right after the official programs ends!
More preicesly, those that want to join can meet up on zoom at 5 PM (the link will be provided during the hackathon)
and will have plenty of options to socialize, talk about the things presented during the day and/or their research.
