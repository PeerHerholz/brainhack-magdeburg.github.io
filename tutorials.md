# Tutorials

We'll have 4 tutorials in total, splitted into two overaching topics and programming languages. They will aim at providing an introduction to the specific programming language and subsequently show how to conduct analyses in them. In the following we provide more information.


## Day 1 - Tutorial 1 - Intro to Python
This introductory tutorial covers the basic syntax and functions of Python, which are useful for getting started with this language and give you the basics to analyse your own data.


## Day 1 - Tutorial 2 - fMRI in Python
This tutorial will discuss how to use the Python programming language in the analysis of neuroimaging data, from preprocessing to statistical analysis using Nipy, Nipype and Nilearn.


## Day 2 - Tutorial 1 - Intro to R
This short tutorial will give an overview of the basis of the syntax, common functions and basic operations in R. 
We will take the first steps together to discover the basics of R programming and get solid foundations for future learning.
The tutorial will be followed by a hands-on part where you can download the code shown during the tutorial and try to use it with your own data


## Day 2 - Tutorial 2 - Meta-analysis in R
During this tutorial you will be walked through the process of conducting a meta-analysis: from preparing the data in excel to the functions used in R to assess outliers and complete the effect-size calculation. 
The tutorial is based on analyses conducted for this publication.
